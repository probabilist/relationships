# relationships

These files provide simple examples of creating relationships between objects in Python. The explanations are in the comments of the code. As such, the code in the module files should be read like the pages of a book. The file names begin with a number that indicates the order in which the files should be read.

These files include examples of the four basic relationship types. These are many-to-one, one-to-one, many-to-many, and one-to-many. We illustrate these relationships with typical gaming objects like characters, items, and spells.

Inside these files, you will find examples of several Python concepts. These include classes, properties, and property setters. There is also an example of creating your own custom list type. This uses the `MutableSequence` class in the `collections.abc` module. We also illustrate a factory pattern. This is where we use a manager class to create and catalog instances of other classes.

I created these tutorials while teaching myself these concepts. So I'm sure they are suboptimal and contain mistakes. I welcome any and all feedback that I might use to improve them.
